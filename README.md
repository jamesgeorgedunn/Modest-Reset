Modest-Reset
============

Modest Size is a simple CSS reset based on the [CSS reset framework by Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

It has additional resets that I find very useful when starting a new project.

These include:
###No marching ants around link elements.
###Textareas that don't resize with user interaction.
###Vertical scrollbar is always present.
